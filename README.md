# customer analytics repo
this repo is only meant to be retrievable quickly and easily in an ordered fashion by me; thats all. 

Credits to the customer analytics course; 
https://www.udemy.com/course/customer-analytics-in-python/

I generally liked it: did not teach me incredibly new things but gave a good summary of how to approach EDA and also demonstrated a good use case of Elasticities. if you follow the course propoerly you will be able to transfer the knowledge easily. so in that regard the course indeed succeeded.
